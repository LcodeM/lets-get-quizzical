## Introduction

Let's Get Quizzical is a general knowledge quiz, with a friendly and simple design, aimed at testing the user's knowledge across a variety of topics with questions ranging in difficulty.

The game is designed to display whether the user has chosen a correct or incorrect answer on click, and preventing them from choosing multiple answers to cheat. Scores are tracked as the user progresses through the questions, with a final score displayed at the end, as well as the option to play again.

Users should enjoy the different question topics, and aim to want to beat their previous score, where possible.

### Site Structure

Let's Get Quizzical utilises a single index.html page, which in turn utilises javascript functions to show and hide various sections from the user, depending on the actions they take on the site (buttons pressed, finished questions etc).

Each section aims to serve a different purpose. The welcome-container acting as the introdcution to the game, and how to play it. The quiz-container, which is hidden upon the page load, holds the questions, and is the main visible element of the site until all questions are answered. Finally, the final-score-container is displayed only when all questions have been answered, displaying the user's final score, as well as the 'Play Again' button which refreshes the page and starts again from the welcome-container.

All content is centered to the middle of the screen, as to prevent the need for scrolling, while still maintaining a good design layout.
